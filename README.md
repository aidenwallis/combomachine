Twitch chat live feed with the ability to stack together emotes that are spammed. Heavily inspired by [DestinyGG](https://destiny.gg) live chat.

Written in pure JS with no framework, connects to Twitch IRC anonymously and simply listens to chat, has support for BetterTTV and FFZ out of the box.

Hosted on netlify at [combomachine.aidenwallis.co.uk](https://combomachine.aidenwallis.co.uk), and bundled with [ParcelJS](https://parceljs.org)!
